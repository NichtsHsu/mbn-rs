# mbn

Library for parsing MBN format.

Basically, it's a Rust rewrite of the relevant parts of [libopenpst](https://github.com/openpst/libopenpst).

Check out [the documentation page](https://docs.rs/mbn) for details.

Here is a [CLI tool](https://github.com/NichtsHsu/mbn-rs) available, and, it is also the best example of this library.
